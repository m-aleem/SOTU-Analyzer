# SOTU-Analyzer
A program which analyzes word usage in the State of the Union Addresses (Python)

Each run of the program generates a PDF report. The first section is a general analysis, and is always the same. It simply shows basic word count stats (as plots) for all SOTU addresses delivered as speeches since 1913. The second portion shows stats related to a specific word the user inputs.
